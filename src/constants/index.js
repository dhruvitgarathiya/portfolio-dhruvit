      "An introduction to React Hooks and how they can be used to manage state and side effects in functional components.",
    link: "/blog/react-hooks",
    content:
      "Hey everyone! i am a student diving into the world of React, and one concept thatâ€™s completely changed how I write code is React Hooks. Hooks let you use state and lifecycle features in functional components, making them simpler and cleaner compared to class components. Before Hooks, managing state or side effects meant dealing with this and lifecycle methods, which felt overwhelming. But with Hooks like useState, useEffect, and useContext, everything became more intuitive. For instance, useState lets you add state to functional components, useEffect handles side effects like API calls, and useContext simplifies accessing global state. Whatâ€™s even cooler is creating custom Hooks to reuse logic across components, making your code more modular and efficient. As a beginner, I started small, building projects like to-do lists and weather apps, which helped me grasp Hooks better. If youâ€™re new to React, donâ€™t stressâ€”start with the basics, practice, and soon youâ€™ll see how Hooks make coding more enjoyable and less complicated. Happy coding! ðŸš€",
