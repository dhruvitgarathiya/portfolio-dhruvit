I build tech that matters.

I’m a full-stack developer, AI aficionado, and robotics engineer obsessed with creating smart systems that seamlessly connect software and hardware. From building web apps with React, Next.js, and Bun to diving deep into ML frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, I’m all about pushing tech to its limits.

Whether I'm developing AI systems or working on robotics projects with Python, C++, and ROS2, I focus on making things that are fast, scalable, and truly impactful. I'm not just coding for the sake of coding. I’m solving real-world problems and creating tech that actually makes life better.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Hey, I'm Mayank – a robotics and AI enthusiast, soon-to-be graduate in Computer Science with a focus on AI & ML at GLA University, India. I’ve been in love with tech since I wrote my first Python script at 16, and I’ve been hooked on turning ideas into reality ever since. 

I’ve built everything from a humanoid robot arm with sensors to diving deep into robotics and AI. I’m all about pushing boundaries, whether that’s optimizing robotics software, tinkering with Linux setups, or building full-stack web apps. I like to experiment, solve problems, and stay hands-on with whatever tech catches my eye. 

When I’m not coding or working with hardware, you’ll probably find me bingeing some anime, exploring the latest in futuristic tech, or sharing my journey on Twitter with fellow tech enthusiasts.

I’m constantly learning and building right now, I'm diving into full-stack web development, AI, and robotics, always looking for new ways to solve real-world challenges. So yeah, I don't settle for ordinary - I'm here to create something that actually makes a difference.`;
